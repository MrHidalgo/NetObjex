        <p class="lInfo__text">Under California law, California residents may request and receive information about a business’s disclosure of certain personal information to other companies for direct marketing purposes. Upon receipt of such request, the business is required to provide a list of all third parties to whom personal information was disclosed in the preceding calendar year, as well as a list of the categories of personal information that were disclosed. However, a business is not required to provide these lists if the business adopts and discloses to the public, in its privacy policy, a policy of not disclosing its user’s personal information to third parties for direct marketing purposes unless the user first affirmatively agrees to the disclosure. As stated above, NetObjex notifies you, through this privacy policy, of your right to prevent the disclosure of personal information.
